      "Amarillo is a privately grown and registered hop variety; it was introduced recently but has been extremely popular with brewers seeking a Cascade-type hop with a distinctive American character. It is considered by many to be ideal for dry hopping, but also gives a clean bitterness due to low cohumulone content. The flavor has citrus and floral notes, and something like a Cascade character, but with more bitterness. Amarillo is a registered trademark of Virgil Gamache Farms, Inc., where the hop was originally developed.",

It is also an ancestor of most modern high-alpha hops. Some Brewer's Gold is still grown in England, but there is no longer significant production in the United States. Brewer's Gold was never used as an aroma hop in England because of its intense flavors, but has been used experimentally as a dry hop by some American craft brewers.",

      'Hallertauer Mittelfrüher or Hallertauer Mittelfrüh is the landrace cultivar of the Hallertau, the premier hop growing region of Germany. When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfrüher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that "Hallertau Hallertauer" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfrüher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name "Hallertau" or "Hallertauer", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfrüher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as "noble" and characteristic of the great German lagers.',

      'Hallertauer Tradition is a German aroma variety, derived from Hallertauer Gold, which was bred as a replacement for Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr?her. It combines a flavor said to be similar to Hallertauer Mittelfr?her with significantly improved disease and pest resistance and higher yield. As with Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr?her, the "Hallertauer" in Hallertauer Tradition is part of the name of the cultivar, and hops of this cultivar grown outside the may also be referred to as Hallertauer Tradition, although it is sometimes simply called Tradition. However, because this variety is currently grown primarily in the Hallertau, the full name is not generally used, and the hop is generally sold simply as Hallertauer Tradition even if it was grown in the Hallertau.',

Although referred to as Styrian Golding, this hop is actually genetically derived from Fuggle rather than Golding hops. At one time the less desirable Fuggles were exported to some areas as "Fuggle Golding," which is probably the source of the name. This hop became the primary hop grown in Styria in the 1930s when their other landrace varieties were severely damaged by powdery mildew. Because it is genetically derived from Fuggle, it is not surprising that Styrian Goldings also resembles Fuggle in character, with a pleasant spicy aroma.',

      "The first hedgerow (dwarf) hop variety to be grown commercially in the United States, and the first to be available to home hop growers as a rhizome, Summit is perhaps the strongest bittering hop available based on early crops. Because of its recent origin, it is not clear how it will develop in large scale commercial production; the numbers given are based on a few early crops. Summit has strong orange/tangerine citrus notes in aroma and flavor and its growers also suggest it as a good candidate for dry hopping. It was also the featured hop used in every beer in the 2006 Single Hop Festival hosted by Drake's Brewing Company.",

      "American hops sold as Tettnanger hops often claim to be the same cultivar as the famous German aroma hop Tettnang Tettnanger. However, in recent years, it has been discovered that these hops are genetically distinct from the German landrace and in fact are most likely Fuggle or a closely related hop. The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.",
